# README

This Web Application is a rather simple one. It was created for my
Web Development Frameworks class. It is a stepping stone into the world of
Ruby on Rails development and it is using basic code that was provided to me
by my instructor. I primarily focused on User Experience / User Interface
design. I have a rather simplistic design for my Web Application that still makes
use of the CRUD functionalities that were given to us via Ruby on Rails and 
the instructor.

A large majority of the edits for this program can be found in the applications.css file as well as the views/tasks/index.html.erb.

Cheers.
